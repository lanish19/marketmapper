Here is a **todo.md-style prompt** to ensure this Marketmapper app/code (which i have dep[loyed to Vercel and has a url already at @https://marketmapper.vercel.app/ ) leverages the existing Redis storage so changes made are persistent and available for all users visiting/revisiting the URL.

# TODO: Enable Persistent and Collaborative Storage with Redis for Marketmapper

## Objective:
Update the Marketmapper application so that **all changes (additions/edits) made by any user are stored in Redis and persist for all users.** When any user visits or revisits the app, they see the current, shared, up-to-date dataset.

## Tasks:

- [ ] **Integrate Redis Storage:**  
  Ensure the app is importing and initializing the official `redis` SDK using the connection details and credentials already available in environment variables (e.g., `REDIS_URL`).

- [ ] **CRUD Operations to Redis:**  
  - When a user makes changes (add, edit, delete entries), update the data in Redis using appropriate keys.
  - Read all relevant data from Redis on every page load (and on-demand, if using client-side state).

- [ ] **Lock-in/Sync Data on Change:**  
  - On every user action that changes data, write the update to Redis immediately.
  - Handle any necessary merging or sync routines if two users update simultaneously.

- [ ] **Real-time Sync (Optional):**  
  Use Redis pub/sub or similar for live collaboration (so all users instantly see each other's changes if they're on the app at the same time).

- [ ] **Data Load on Visit:**  
  When a visitor loads the app, always fetch the latest state/data set from Redisâ€”do not rely on local cache for critical collaborative data.

- [ ] **Testing:**  
  - Simulate two users by opening the app in two browsers/incognito and verify both see updated/persistent data after edits.
  - Refresh pages to check for persistence.

- [ ] **Security:**  
  Make sure write and read actions are authenticated as required. Consider rate-limiting and/or permission logic if needed.

## Example Code Snippet:

```js
import { createClient } from 'redis';
const redis = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });
await redis.connect();

// Add or update an entry
await redis.set('entries', JSON.stringify(updatedEntries));

// Get entries (on load)
const entries = JSON.parse(await redis.get('entries'));
```

## Notes:
- Use simple key structure unless you need multiple data collections (i.e., `"entries"`, `"users:x:items"`, etc.).
- Document Redis usage and environment variable requirements in your project README.

This prompt provides everything an AI agent or dev will need to make your changes collaborative and persistent using your Redis storage.

**NOTE:** Redis connection details are configured via environment variables in the Vercel deployment. The REDIS_URL environment variable should be set in your Vercel project settings.

Example Redis usage patterns:

```javascript
import { createClient } from "redis"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"

const redis = await createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL }).connect();

export async function GET() {
  const value = await redis.get("myKey")
  return NextResponse.json({ value })
}
```

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const redis = await createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL }).connect();

await redis.set('key', 'value');
const value = await redis.get('key');
```

```python
import redis
import os

r = redis.Redis.from_url(os.environ.get('REDIS_URL'))

success = r.set("foo", "bar")
# True

result = r.get("foo")
print(result)
# >>> bar
```
